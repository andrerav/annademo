# AnNa MSW Spreadsheet Parser
The AnNa Spreadsheet common pilot project aims to create a common harmonized Spreadsheet Template as a tool to facilitate the maritime industry when reporting large amounts of information into an EU Single Window. The Spreadsheet template is developed in accordance with EU Directive 2010/65/EC, and the work done by the eMS work on Data mapping.

The current version of the template comprises harmonized reporting that are considered to be bulky data and can be used by any Member States implementing their graphical Single Window- or Port Community system(s).

This project provides a working implementation for parsing the contents of a standards compliant AnNa spreadsheet.
